- 👋 Hi, I’m @hoangkimmanhha, you can call me Hà, or my nickname Hades. I was born in 2007. I'm from Vietnam, so English is my second language (so it's quite a problem and I'm trying to improve it day by day)
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, Photoshop, and I'm also a big fan of music (especially Chinese songs 🇨🇳), I play badminton as well. I'm very simple so don't even mind me🤣
- 📚 I started my coding journey when I was 14, I've found the inspriration in every single line of code, it sometime confuses me but I still love it💖💗
- ⛪ About religion, I'm a Christian, so I trust in Jesus Christ.
- 🌱 I know Pascal (💀), I’m currently learning Python and a little bit of JS (JS really hard so I taking a break a while but I will continue learn it pretty soon when I have a bunch of time)
- 👑 I was rewarded some prizes and certificates about coding (never mind, it don't make sense, I mean Pascal 😂)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python projects
- 📫 You can reach me via email: hoangkimmanhha@outlook.com
- 😄 Serious at work, fun at play, honest in luv, and really good at coding😁
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't have gf LOL😂
