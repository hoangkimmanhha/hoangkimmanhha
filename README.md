- 👋 Hi, I’m @hoangkimmanhha, you can call me Hà, or my nickname Hades. I was born in 2007. I'm from Vietnam, so English is my second language (so it obviously a problem and I trying to improve it day by day)
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, Photoshop, a big fan of music, badminton. I'm very simple you don't even mind it🤣
- 📚 I started my coding journey when I 14, I've found the inspriration in every single line of code, it sometime confused me but I still love it💖💗
- ⛪ About religion, I'm a Christian, so I trust in Jesus Christ
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and a little bit of JS (JS really hard so I taking a break a while but I will continue learn it pretty soon when I have a bunch of time)
- 👑 I was rewarded some prizes and certificates about coding (never mind, it don't make sense 😂)
